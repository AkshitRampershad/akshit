									<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
									<p>At the University of South Florida, in pursuit of a master's degree in Business Analytics and Information Systems, I have immersed myself in diverse projects that have equipped me with valuable skills in Business Intelligence and Data Analysis. Utilizing tools such as Tableau, NLI, ML, and Python, I have provided real-world solutions, including analyzing U.S. recessions, exploring multilingual text relationships through NLI frameworks, and building predictive machine learning models for monkeypox and abnormal heart rates. My academic journey has not only honed my technical skills but has also instilled in me a passion for collaborative problem-solving.</p>

											<p>The article highlights the issue of algorithmic bias and presents practical solutions to minimize its impact. This is a crucial issue for the future because AI is becoming more and more widespread in various fields, such as hiring, criminal justice, and social media. (Designing AI for All, p. 1) It is vital to understand and reduce algorithmic bias to ensure that AI systems are just unbiased, and responsible. Ultimately, this will create a future where technology benefits everyone and does not perpetuate societal biases.</p>
